## üìù Overview

This project simulates a **lateral movement and remote code execution attack** from a Kali Linux machine against a Windows 11 target.  
The detection is performed using **Splunk** and **Sysmon**, creating a realistic scenario for Blue Team training and portfolio building.

## üß∞ Lab Setup

| Machine | Role |
|----------|------|
| **Kali Linux** | Attacker (Impacket, smbclient, CrackMapExec, etc.) |
| **Windows 11 VM** | Victim (Splunk, Sysmon, logging configured) |
| **Splunk Enterprise** | Log collection and analysis |

‚öôÔ∏è Windows 11 Installation (Victim Machine)
	1.	Download Windows 11 ISO from Microsoft.
	2.	Create a Virtual Machine using VirtualBox, VMware or UTM with bridged or host-only networking.
	3.	Set up Administrator user, disable UAC popups, configure networking, and install Remote Desktop if needed.

üõ†Ô∏è Kali Linux Setup (Attacker Machine)
	1.	Download Kali ISO from kali.org.
        2.     Update and upgrade Kali: 
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
	3.	Install Impacket & Tools:
sudo apt install impacket crackmapexec smbclient
	4.	Set networking in VM to communicate with Windows (bridged, NAT or host-only).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Windows 11 Vulnerable Configuration

**Disable security features to simulate a vulnerable environment:**

```powershell
# Disable Defender
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
Set-MpPreference -DisableBehaviorMonitoring $true
Set-MpPreference -DisableBlockAtFirstSeen $true
Set-MpPreference -DisableIOAVProtection $true

# Disable Firewall
Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Domain,Public,Private -Enabled False

# Enable Admin Shares
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

üîç Logging Configuration

Enable auditing policies:

AuditPol /set /subcategory:"Logon" /success:enable /failure:enable
AuditPol /set /subcategory:"Process Creation" /success:enable

# Enable command line logging
reg add "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\Audit" /v ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

üêæ Installing Sysmon

Download Sysmon from:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon

Download a pre-configured¬†sysmonconfig.xml¬†from¬†Sysmon Modular.

Open¬†PowerShell as Administrator¬†and run: cd "C:\Users\Downloads\sysmon"

.\sysmon64.exe -i sysmonconfig.xml

Verify Sysmon is running:

Get-Process sysmon64

üìà Installing Splunk
	1.	Download Splunk Enterprise (Trial):

https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html

	2.	Configure Splunk Inputs:

	‚Ä¢	WinEventLog: Security
	‚Ä¢	WinEventLog: System
	‚Ä¢	WinEventLog: Application
	‚Ä¢	Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational
	‚Ä¢	Sysmon Event Logs (if installed)

	3.	Verify event ingestion into Splunk

üîÆ Next Steps & Future Improvements

This lab is an initial step towards building a more comprehensive security operations and detection portfolio.
Here are the planned next steps and possible improvements:

üõ†Ô∏è Planned Enhancements
	‚Ä¢	Add Real-Time Alerting
Configure Splunk alert rules to generate real-time notifications (email/webhook) for lateral movement and suspicious logons.
	‚Ä¢	Integrate MITRE ATT&CK Tags in Splunk Dashboards
Create custom dashboards that map the detected events directly to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
	‚Ä¢	Use Splunk Enterprise Security or Open-Source SIEM Alternatives
Expand detection capabilities with pre-built correlation rules (if licensing permits).
	‚Ä¢	Include PowerShell Attack Simulation
Simulate Invoke-Mimikatz or remote PowerShell Remoting scenarios and analyze the logs generated.
	‚Ä¢	Expand to Cloud Monitoring
Integrate Azure or AWS event logs to simulate hybrid environment monitoring.
	‚Ä¢	Automate Lab Deployment
Use Terraform, Vagrant, or Ansible to automate lab creation for faster re-deployment.
	‚Ä¢	Contribute Sigma Rules
Convert the Splunk detection queries into Sigma format for SOC interoperability.
